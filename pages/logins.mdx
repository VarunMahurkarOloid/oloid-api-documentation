In this guide, we will help you get started with the Oloid API, specifically focusing on the **Login API** that allows you to authenticate users and obtain an `id-token` for secure access to protected resources.

## ðŸš€ Login API

The Login API is the first step in integrating authentication into your app. It enables users to log in and retrieve an **id-token**, which can be used for further authenticated API requests.

### Endpoint

###### POST: /login

### Request Body

To authenticate a user, send a `POST` request to the `/login` endpoint with the following JSON payload:

```json
{
  "UserName": "johndoe@oloid.ai",
  "TenantName": "preview",
  "Password": "MySecretPass123"
}
```
